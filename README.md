# Cooper Union CHESS CS Lectures
## Vaibhav Hariani, August 2025

These lectures can be built with [mdslides](https://gitlab.com/da_doomer/markdown-slides).  
We provide an additional build script, which uses this software. However, these docs can operate as plain markdown, as well.  

All docs are covered under the GFDLv1.3
