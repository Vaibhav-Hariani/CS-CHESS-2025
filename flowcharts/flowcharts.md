## Brief Intro

Welcome to Chess! 

I'm Vaibhav Hariani [vaibhav.hariani@cooper.edu], a senior EE. 
Throughout the lecture, please do not be afraid to ask any questions!

## Some basic objectives before we start:

[comment]: # (!!!)

- This crash course is designed for you to learn how to break down a CS problem, and approach it!

- For some of you, these lessons might seem unnecessary. 
- For others, this might be too much. 
- Work with each other, and I hope everyone comes out of this with something.
- Homework: I'm not grading anything, but it should help drill things home!

## What is a programming language? 

## Have you used any before?

## What are they good for?
  
[comment]: # (!!!)
- Algorithms are sets of rules to be followed, that allow us (or machines) to complete certain tasks. 

- Before we get into programming (and CS), let's talk about some simple algorithms you use all the time. 

- Then, we'll learn some of the tools computer scientists use to solve problems.

## Lesson 1.1: Flowcharts
![basically, this.](media/xkdc.png)

Note:
WE DONT CARE ABOUT SPECIFICS!!!
For now, just describe whats going on, theres a problem posed, and its being solved.

[comment]: # (!!!)

Flowcharts let us take large, complex problems, and break them down into chunks.

In the context of computer science, we can use these to think about how to 
implement our goals into code.

## Ok, how do I start making one of these?

- Determine the problem
- Consider each factor involved
- What are the inputs?
- From that, consider the steps involved to process your input into an output, 
from start to end.

### Flowchart Operators: Terminal

<div style="font-size: .8em;">
(as according to ISO 5807.. your mileage may vary.....)
</div>

![term](media/ops/term.svg)<!-- .element: style="height:20vh; image-rendering: crisp-edges;" -->

The Terminal represents the *start* or *end* of a flowchart, and is usually 
labeled as such, either explicitly or implicitly (eg. "receive signal")

### Flowchart Operators: Process
![term](media/ops/proc.svg)<!-- .element: style="height:20vh; image-rendering: crisp-edges;" -->

The Process represents a (group of) operation(s) which *changes* our information 
in some way.

[comment]: # (|||)

### Flowchart Operators: Decision
![term](media/ops/dec.svg)<!-- .element: style="height:20vh; image-rendering: crisp-edges;" -->

The Decision operator changes our flow based on the *condition* set inside of 
the operator.

### Flowchart Operators: I/O
![term](media/ops/io.svg)<!-- .element: style="height:20vh; image-rendering: crisp-edges;" -->

The I/O (in/out) operator represents either the input or output of information 
into our workflow.

Note:
The diagram we've shown INTENTIONALLY violates ISO5807: The start blocks and I/O are all different!
Standards are secondary to CLARITY. We can still understand the process!

## Your turn:
Consider you're at home, and need to decide to go grocery shopping or not. 

What do you need in order to get that done? (eg, do i have time?) Can you do it? 
Make a flowchart to figure that out.
